## [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning)

This repositorium consists of my project's notebooks for IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera. 
All projects were done on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and can be found in my profile on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/semenvasilev).


## About the certificate
The IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate consists of 5 courses that provide solid theoretical understanding and considerable practice of the main algorithms, uses, and best practices related to Machine Learning. 
  
Throughout this Professional Certificate, I study how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. Also, I gained theoretical knowledge and practical skill in Machine Learning (Regression and Classification, Clustering) and Deep Learning (Fully connected Neural Networks and Convolutions Neural Networks).   

- Language: Python.
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, Keras, and TensorFlow.  

## Achivments
I took participation in [kaggle SpaseShip Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).
My best solution achieved the Top 8 % of the leadership board.
